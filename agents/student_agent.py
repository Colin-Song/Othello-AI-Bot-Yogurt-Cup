    Implement the step function of your agent here.
    You can use the following variables to access the chess board:
    - chess_board: a numpy array of shape (board_size, board_size)
      where 0 represents an empty spot, 1 represents Player 1's discs (Blue),
      and 2 represents Player 2's discs (Brown).
    - player: 1 if this agent is playing as Player 1 (Blue), or 2 if playing as Player 2 (Brown).
    - opponent: 1 if the opponent is Player 1 (Blue), or 2 if the opponent is Player 2 (Brown).

    You should return a tuple (r,c), where (r,c) is the position where your agent
    wants to place the next disc. Use functions in helpers to determine valid moves
    and more helpful tools.

    Please check the sample implementation in agents/random_agent.py or agents/human_agent.py for more details.
